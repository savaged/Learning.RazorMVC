# Learning.RazorMVC

Some fun learning MVC with Razor (also Dapper with a generic data service)

## Prerequisites
Using a Sqlite3 client application, add a database named Database.sqlite3 in the wwwroot folder. Then add the Lease and User tables using the create statements from the top of the model class definitions/files.
